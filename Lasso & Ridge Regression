DESCRIPTION
Consider an automobile data set with values such as Name of the car Model, its mileage, number of cylinders, number of gears and so on. 
 
The data is present in the file named mtcars.csv which is present at the location /data/training/mtcars.csv
 
Write a Python code to calculate the difference between the means 10-fold cross validation scores of ridge regression and lasso regression with alpha as 1.0
                
Hint: Perform steps as mentioned below:
Load data
Use all the columns except ‘mpg’ & ‘model’ as predictors (x)
Use ‘mpg’ as the response column(y)
Perform Lasso & Ridge regression on this data. Use all the rows as training data for performing regression.
Perform cross validation on both the regression results for the above x & y with cv=10 and default scoring
Calculate and print the difference by subtracting the mean score of ridge from the mean score of lasso regression
